OBJECT CLASS :
1) built in class sits at the top of the class hierarchy tree
a) .equals() = it checks two objects are equal
b).toString() = returns string representation of the object
c).finalize() = is a member function that will be called when object is about to cease to exist ( Garbage collected)
     - The default implementation of ".finalize()" is blank,
        but override it if your object has any resources that need cleaning up
        eg : files to be closed
