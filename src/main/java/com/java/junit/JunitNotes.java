4.Provides automation testing and validation
5.run several test in one execution
6.After all unit testing is done , integration tests are next
 -When testing, we need to identify any inputs to methods in our code as well as expected results.
7.Integration testing is used to test the entire system
  - An integration test aims to test the behavior of a component or the integration between multiple components. These tests are used to test the entire system.
8.Performace testing benchmark the software by running repeatedly
   -The purpose is to ensure the code runs fast enough under a high traffic load

==============Using Assertions===============
1.Provides overloaded assertion methods
2.Parameter order is (expected value,actualvlaue)
3.String message can also be added as first parameter
 - Actual & Expected values for
